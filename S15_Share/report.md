### The Superman Movie Franchise: Historical Overview

The Superman movie franchise has a long and storied history, beginning with *Superman: The Movie* (1978), starring Christopher Reeve, which set a high bar for superhero films. This film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over \$300 million worldwide on a budget of \$55 million. Its success led to several sequels, including *Superman II* (1980), *Superman III* (1983), and *Superman IV: The Quest for Peace* (1987). While the sequels had varying degrees of success, none captured the magic of the original.     

The franchise was revived in 2006 with *Superman Returns*, directed by Bryan Singer and starring Brandon Routh as Superman.

In 2013, Zack Snyder directed *Man of Steel*, starring Henry Cavill as Superman. This film took a darker and more action-oriented approach to the character, dividing audiences. It grossed over \$668 million worldwide on a budget of \$225 million. Cavill reprised the role in *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice* (2016) and *Justice League* (2017), but these films also received mixed reviews.
