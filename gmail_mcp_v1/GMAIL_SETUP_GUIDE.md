## üéâ Verification

Your `gmail_mcp_v1/` folder should now contain:
```
gmail_mcp_v1/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ credentials.json          ‚Üê Your downloaded file (NEW!)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp_server.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup_and_run.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other files)
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Error: "credentials.json not found"
- **Solution:** Make sure the file is named exactly `credentials.json` (not `credentials.json.txt`)
- **Check location:** File must be directly in the `gmail_mcp_v1/` folder

### Error: "Gmail API not enabled"
- **Solution:** Go back to Google Cloud Console ‚Üí APIs & Services ‚Üí Library
- **Search:** "Gmail API" and make sure it shows "API enabled"

### Error: "OAuth consent screen not configured"  
- **Solution:** Complete Step 4 above, especially adding yourself as a test user

### Error: "Access denied" or "insufficient scopes"
- **Solution:** 
  1. Delete the `token.json` file
  2. Run the setup again
  3. Grant all requested permissions

## üîí Security Notes

- **Keep credentials.json secure** - it contains your OAuth client secret
- **Don't share credentials.json** - it's specific to your project
- **Token.json** is auto-generated and contains your access tokens
- **For production use:** Use environment variables instead of credential files

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. **Check the logs:** Look at `gmail_agent.log` for detailed error messages
2. **Verify project:** Make sure you're using the correct Google Cloud project
3. **Double-check steps:** Ensure Gmail API is enabled and OAuth is configured
4. **Test with simple command:** Try "Check my Gmail account status" first
