# 🚀 Viral LinkedIn Post - Web Lego Extension

## 🎯 Main Post

**🧱 My kid just taught me something about web design...**

Last weekend, my kid was playing with LEGO blocks, building this amazing castle by taking pieces from different sets. 

"Dad," they said, "why can't we do this with websites?"

🤔 That question hit different.

So we spent the weekend building something together - a Chrome extension that lets you grab ANY element from ANY webpage and rearrange them like LEGO blocks.

**The result? "Web Lego" - and it's honestly mind-blowing.**

✨ Here's what happened:
• We grabbed a header from one site
• Took a pricing table from another
• Borrowed an image gallery from a third
• Mixed them into something completely new

**In 30 seconds. No coding. Just drag and drop.**

My kid's reaction: "Dad, we just hacked the internet!" 😂

The best part? Everything exports as real, working HTML. 

**Sometimes the best ideas come from the most unexpected places.**

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Who else codes with their kids? What have they taught you?**

🔗 **GitHub**: https://github.com/[your-username]/web-lego
📦 **Chrome Extension**: Available now (free & open-source)

P.S. - Because good ideas should be shared, especially when they come from kid wisdom.
