# 🌱 CarbonLens: The AI That Helps You Shop Sustainably

Ever wondered if your next iPhone purchase could save 50kg of CO2? Or which gaming console is actually better for the planet?

I built **CarbonLens** - an AI agent that analyzes real carbon emissions data and gives you instant sustainability insights before you buy.

## Here's what makes it powerful:

🧠 **Ask in Plain English**: "Should I buy PlayStation 5 or Xbox for lowest carbon footprint?"  
📊 **Real Enterprise APIs**: Live data from Carbon Interface, Climatiq, ElectricityMap & NewsAPI  
🎯 **Monte Carlo Analysis**: Statistical uncertainty modeling with 1000+ sample simulations  
📈 **Interactive Visualizations**: See exactly where emissions come from (manufacturing vs usage)  
⚡ **Instant Recommendations**: Get clear "buy this, not that" guidance with reasoning  

## The Tech Behind It:
- 🤖 **Google Gemini Flash** - Latest AI model for intelligent reasoning
- 🔬 **Carbon Interface API** (https://carboninterface.com) - Emission factor calculations  
- 🌍 **Climatiq API** (https://climatiq.io) - Life cycle assessment database
- ⚡ **ElectricityMap API** (https://electricitymaps.com) - Real-time grid carbon intensity
- 📰 **NewsAPI** (https://newsapi.org) - Latest sustainability news
- 📊 **Apache ECharts** - Professional data visualization
- ⚛️ **React + TypeScript** - Modern web architecture

## Real Results That Matter:
Query: *"Gaming setup for Indian market - which is greenest?"*  

**AI Agent Process:**
1. Calls Climatiq API → Gets manufacturing emissions  
2. Calls ElectricityMap → Analyzes India's grid intensity (720g CO2/kWh)  
3. Runs Monte Carlo simulation → Accounts for uncertainty  
4. Searches NewsAPI → Finds latest sustainability trends  
5. Generates visual comparison → Clear winner emerges  

**Result:** PlayStation 5 (318kg CO2e) beats Gaming PC (737kg CO2e) by 57%! 🎮

## Why This Could Go Viral:
- **Timing**: COP29 just ended, sustainability is trending
- **Practical**: Everyone shops, everyone can use this  
- **Surprising**: Results often contradict assumptions
- **Shareable**: Beautiful charts people want to post
- **Actionable**: Real money-saving + planet-saving decisions

The agent doesn't just give you numbers - it shows the complete research trail like a sustainability detective, calling multiple APIs and reasoning through complex trade-offs.
