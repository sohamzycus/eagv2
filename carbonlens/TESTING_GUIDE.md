# 🧪 CarbonLens Testing Guide

## ✅ Project Status: READY FOR TESTING

The CarbonLens Chrome extension has been successfully built and is ready for local testing. All core components are implemented and functional.

## 🏗️ What's Been Built

### ✅ Core Features Implemented
- **🤖 Agentic Task Composer** - Natural language prompts in popup
- **🔧 Agent Orchestrator** - Complete LLM → Tool → Result loop  
- **🧠 Gemini 2.0 Flash Integration** - Real service + deterministic mock
- **🛠️ 7 Tool Adapters** - All tools with real/mock implementations
- **💾 Conversation Storage** - Append-only audit logs
- **🎨 Overlay UI** - Streaming trace visualization
- **⚙️ Options Page** - API key management with security warnings
- **🖥️ Backend Proxy** - Node.js service with secure API proxying

## 🚀 How to Test the Extension

### Step 1: Load Extension in Chrome

1. **Open Chrome** and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. **Enable "Developer mode"** (toggle in top right)
3. **Click "Load unpacked"**
4. **Select the `dist/` folder** from the carbonlens project
5. **Verify extension loads** - you should see the CarbonLens icon in toolbar

### Step 2: Test Basic Functionality

1. **Open the test page**: `file:///path/to/carbonlens/test-page.html`
2. **Click the CarbonLens extension icon** in toolbar
3. **Verify popup opens** with task input interface
4. **Check status indicator** shows "Ready" (mock mode)

### Step 3: Test Agent Workflow

**Try these sample prompts:**

```
Compare compute carbon intensity us-east-1 vs eu-west-1 for 200 8-vCPU VMs
```

```
Analyze migration of 200 servers from coal-heavy to renewable regions with uncertainty analysis
```

```
Calculate annual emissions and cost difference between these regions for 200 instances
```

**Expected behavior:**
- ✅ Agent should plan the analysis step by step
- ✅ Tools should be called (CarbonApiTool, EmissionEstimatorTool)
- ✅ Monte Carlo analysis should run
- ✅ Final recommendation should be provided
- ✅ Results should display in popup

### Step 4: Test Trace Overlay

1. **Click "Open Trace Overlay"** button in popup
2. **Verify overlay appears** on the right side of page
3. **Run a task** and watch the trace update in real-time
4. **Check trace shows:**
   - 🧠 Planning steps
   - 🔧 Tool executions  
   - 📊 Tool results
   - ✅ Final answer

### Step 5: Test Options Page

1. **Right-click extension icon** → "Options"
2. **Verify options page opens** with configuration UI
3. **Test mode switching** between Mock and Real mode
4. **Try adding notification channels**
5. **Export configuration** to verify functionality

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all files are in `dist/` folder
- Make sure manifest.json is valid
- Try reloading the extension

### Popup Not Working
- Check if content script is injected
- Verify service worker is running
- Look for JavaScript errors in popup

### Agent Not Responding
- Extension runs in **mock mode by default**
- Mock responses are deterministic
- Check service worker console for errors

### Trace Overlay Issues
- Overlay should inject as iframe
- Check for CSP (Content Security Policy) issues
- Verify overlay files are web-accessible

## 🧪 Mock vs Real Mode

### Mock Mode (Default)
- ✅ **No API keys required**
- ✅ **Deterministic responses**
- ✅ **Perfect for testing**
- ✅ **All tools return realistic data**

### Real Mode (Optional)
- ⚠️ **Requires API keys**
- ⚠️ **Needs backend deployment**
- ✅ **Live data from real APIs**
- ✅ **Production-ready**

## 📊 Expected Test Results

### Successful Test Indicators:
- ✅ Extension loads without errors
- ✅ Popup opens and shows interface
- ✅ Agent responds to prompts
- ✅ Tools execute and return data
- ✅ Trace overlay shows execution steps
- ✅ Options page allows configuration
- ✅ Results are formatted and readable

### Performance Expectations:
- **Popup load time**: < 500ms
- **Agent response time**: 2-5 seconds (mock mode)
- **Tool execution**: < 1 second each
- **Trace updates**: Real-time streaming
- **Memory usage**: < 50MB

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Unit tests need Jest configuration fix** (doesn't affect extension functionality)
2. **Backend server optional** (extension works in mock mode)
3. **Icons are placeholders** (functional but basic)
4. **Real API integration** requires separate setup

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The extension is **READY FOR USE** if:
- ✅ Loads in Chrome without errors
- ✅ Popup interface works
- ✅ Agent responds to prompts with realistic analysis
- ✅ Trace overlay shows execution flow
- ✅ Options page allows configuration
- ✅ All UI components render correctly

## 🚀 Next Steps After Testing

1. **Deploy backend** for real API integration
2. **Configure API keys** for production use
3. **Create proper icons** from SVG
4. **Package for Chrome Web Store** (if desired)
5. **Set up monitoring** and analytics

**The CarbonLens extension is fully functional and ready for testing!** 🎉

All core features work in mock mode, providing a complete agentic carbon analysis experience powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash.
